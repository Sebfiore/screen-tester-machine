# Screen Tester Machine

This repository documents the development of a machine designed to **automate the testing and validation of capacitive touch displays**. The project focuses on three main areas: **mechanical design**, **electrical integration**, and **software development**.

## üß† Motivation

In the production of capacitive touchscreen devices, **validation of components** is a crucial step to ensure performance, durability, and consistency. Traditionally, this validation is carried out manually, making the process **time-consuming**, **inconsistent**, and **labor-intensive**.

By introducing **automation**, it becomes possible to:
- Standardize and speed up the testing process
- Improve repeatability and reliability
- Reduce manual labor and operator fatigue

This project aims to address these needs by providing a modular, programmable solution for touchscreen testing.
